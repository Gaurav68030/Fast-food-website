# Fast-food-website
In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, fast-food delivery services have become an essential part of daily living. With the rapid expansion of global fast-food chains such as Burger King, KFC, Domino’s, and McDonald’s across India, users expect quick access to menus, smooth navigation, and a hassle-free ordering experience. However, many existing platforms are overloaded with complex features, leading to poor usability and inefficient user interaction.
The Fast-Food Ordering Website project is designed to address these challenges by providing a simple, centralized, and user-friendly interface that allows users to browse multiple fast-food brands from a single platform. The website enables customers to select a brand, explore categorized menus, add items to a cart, and proceed through a clear and intuitive checkout process.
